This is an app I created for a personal use case of mine. It stores a collection of quotes into a database.

## Technologies

It's written in C++ and QML via the Qt Quick framework. It also makes use of SQLite.

The app icon is an artwork of the main entrance to [Isfahan University of Technology (IUT)](https://english.iut.ac.ir) in my hometown. I hereby claim all the copyright laws pertaining to the artwork.

## Nomenclature

Mahya (مهیا) is a Persian girl's name. It may be written in one of two spellings, one of which, the one I intended in fact, is more unique than the other.
