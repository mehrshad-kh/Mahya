This is an app I created for a personal use case of mine.  
It is named after the woman with whom the project is related to.  
It's written C++ and QML via the Qt Quick framework. It also makes use of SQLite.  
The app icon is an artwork of the main entrance to [Isfahan University of Technology (IUT)](https://english.iut.ac.ir) in my hometown. I hereby claim all the copyright laws pertaining to the artwork.
